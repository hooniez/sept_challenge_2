This assignment is about creating a Fund Management Service that focuses on account management. The aim is to build two microservices that can handle the creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of persons and their accounts. The code will be maintained on Github with a Dev branch for implementation and a Main branch for the final release. To implement each feature, a feature branch will be created and merged into the Dev branch when it's ready. The services will then be dockerized, along with the local database, to run locally on different ports for testing through Postman. The assignment requires writing three unit tests for each service's controllers. The application will be built, run, and tested through Github Actions CI, with a local database (MySQL) and not on the cloud. The application should have separate packages for the controller, dao, exception, and model. There will be two services, each with two endpoints for creating a person, retrieving an item, retrieving a list of items, and updating an item.
